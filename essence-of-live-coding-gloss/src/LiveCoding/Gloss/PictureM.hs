-- | The monad transformer that captures the effects of gloss,
-- which are reading events and writing pictures.

-- You can call these effects for example by...
--
-- * ...using 'ask' to read the events that occurred,
-- * ...composing a cell with 'addPicture' to paint a picture.

-- | 'PictureT' specialised to the 'IO' monad.
